# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It serves as a personal reference and learning resource for DSA concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different directories based on data structures and problem categories:

### Array Problems
- `remove-duplicates.js`: Implementation of removing duplicates from a sorted array
- `rotation.js`: Array rotation algorithms
- `second-largest.js`: Finding the second largest element in an array
- `script.js`: Various array manipulation utilities

### Stack Problems
- `valid-paranthesis.js`: Implementation of valid parenthesis checking using stack
- `reverse-string.js`: String reversal using stack
- `stack-implementation.js`: Basic stack data structure implementation

## Problem Categories

### Array
- Duplicate removal
- Array rotation
- Finding second largest element
- Array manipulation utilities

### Stack
- Valid parenthesis checking
- String reversal
- Stack data structure implementation

## Usage

Each file contains a standalone implementation of a specific problem or data structure. You can run the files using Node.js:

```bash
node <filename>.js
```

## Contributing

This is a personal practice repository. Feel free to use the code as a reference, but please note that these are practice implementations and may not be optimized for production use.
